## Features

- **Data Source:** The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to ensure data quality and to uncover key patterns that can influence the prediction model.
- **Feature Engineering:** Performed feature engineering to enhance the quality of model inputs, which are crucial for accurate predictions.
- **Logistic Regression Model:** Applied logistic regression to predict the probability of the second team winning the match.
- **User Interface:** Developed with Streamlit, this interface allows users to view the win probabilities of the teams in real-time.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion:** The dataset is imported and pre-processed, including handling missing values.
2. **EDA:** Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to gain insights into the data and identify key patterns that can influence the outcome of the matches.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Created and selected features that significantly contribute to the model's performance.
4. **Model Implementation:** Logistic regression is used to estimate the win probability of the second team.
5. **Streamlit UI:** A simple and interactive user interface where users can input match details and get the win probability displayed.

## Installation and Usage
